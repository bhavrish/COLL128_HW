Piping is an important feature in UNIX that allows programs to pass data to each other. For example, one instance of where piping was used was to create a spell checker by solely leveraging other programs already on the computer (such as a word splitter, dictionary look up, etc.). Another useful UNIX feature is file redirection which allows programs to redirect their input/ output to a file rather than STDIN/ STDOUT.
